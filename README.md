a hyper-casual arcade game in Unity based on a tutorial, created as a learning
project to explore core design principles and mechanics of the hyper-casual genre:

• One-Tap Control Mechanism: Designed a single-click control system where the player
changes rotation direction to navigate obstacles.

• Progressive Scoring: Created a score system that increases over time, with level-based
di­culty scaling.

• High Score Saving: Used PlayerPrefs to store and display best scores in, including new
record tracking.
